# VHDL Elevator Project

This project is an elevator system designed in VHDL during the 1st year of study at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. It comprises a complex hardware system that manages floor requests, displays the current floor, and implements various practical functionalities of a real-life elevator. The project was simulated on a Basys-3 board and was realized alongside my colleague Morari Camelia.

## Overview

The VHDL Elevator Project implements the functionality of a real-life elevator using VHDL hardware description language. It includes features such as floor management, call requests, and floor display. The project aims to provide a comprehensive simulation of elevator operations.

## Features

- Implementation of an elevator system in VHDL.
- Management of floor requests and call signals.
- Display of the current floor.
- Simulation on a Basys-3 board.

## Usage

To use the VHDL Elevator Project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Basys-3 board according to the provided instructions.
2. Download the VHDL source files onto the board.
3. Power on the board and follow the prompts to simulate elevator operations.
4. Experiment with different scenarios to observe the system's behavior.
